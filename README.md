# Sudoku Game
## Play : https://advance-sudoku-game.vercel.app/
A Sudoku game built with React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This game includes dynamic difficulty selection, timer, error handling, and win conditions. The player is given three chances to make a mistake before the game ends.

## Features

- **Timer**: Tracks the time taken to solve the puzzle.
- **Error Handling**: Highlights incorrect inputs in red and limits the player to 3 mistakes.
- **Game Over & Win Messages**: Displays a "Game Over" message after 3 wrong inputs, and a "You Win!" message when the puzzle is solved.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly, responsive layout.
- **Difficulty Selector**: Choose between 4 difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, extreme).
